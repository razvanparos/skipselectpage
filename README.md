This is my approach for the skip selection page using React, Typescript and TailwindCSS with focus on responsiveness, UI/UX, semantic HTML and reusable components.

HEADER COMPONENT
-on the example page the header was not displayed correctly on mobile devices, so I improved it with a sidebar menu where users can navigate to previous steps.
-kept the progress steps and added a progress bar to improve user experience.

FILER COMPONENT
-added a filter component for the scalability of the project in case in the future more skip options are added.
-users can select the skip size range, price range, road allowance and if suitable for heavy waste.

SKIP SELECTOR
-clear 3 column grid for improved visability 
-each skip has a card with the corresponding information
-when a card is selected, the user can continue with the next step or click the card again to go back
-used smooth transitions for UI/UX improvement
